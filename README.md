# RainbowCORE

A small JavaScript, JQuery, and CSS based extension that allowed EtQ Support Techs to highlight ticket rows and customize their EtQ CORE HelpDesk views within EtQ Reliance

These files rely and use the [Greasemonkey FireFox Extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) and/or the [Violentmonkey Firefox Extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/violentmonkey/). 

## No Longer being updated and Supported

I had a fantastic time working on this project, but sadly the project will be coming a close. The development of RainbowCORE was to make front-end changes and design changes to an internal product used at EtQ. Nov 11, 2017, marks my departure from EtQ. This means I will no longer have access to any of the internal products, and also means I will no longer be able to test RainbowCORE against the product it was designed to work with.

This project has been very fun, and I hope that its current state will continue to provide help or knowledge to others.
